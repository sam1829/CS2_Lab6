I created a test file called mymovies, which I used along with test1 (provided by the webpage) to test my material. It
was used in order to use different names and test validity, as well as to complete every aspect of the checks
created in ThreeDegrees. The actor names are as follows (some of which have connections to other movies, some with
no connections, etc.) The actors and their respective movies are as follows:

Lord of the Rings, which starred Andy Serkis, Elijah Wood, Orlando Bloom, and Sean Bean.
The Prestige, which starred David Bowie, Christian Bale, Scarlett Johansson, Andy Serkis, and Hugh Jackman.
The Dark Knight, which starred Christian Bale, Morgan Freeman, and Heath Ledger.
Brokeback Mountain, which starred Heath Ledger and Anne Hathaway.
Lucy, which starred Scarlett Johansson and Morgan Freeman.
Les Miserables, which starred Anne Hathaway and Hugh Jackman.
Avengers: Age of Ultron, which starred Scarlett Johansson, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, and Andy Serkis.
The Conjuring, which starred Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson.

ThreeDegrees prints out the following when this test file is used:

As you can see, the file runs properly using multiple different checks as to whether actors exist, if they are in the
same movie, if they are the same actor, and just overall connections.
